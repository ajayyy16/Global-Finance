# Global Finance SQL Analysis 

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores global finance and trade data using SQL.
The dataset contains financial, economic, and trade indicators across multiple countries, allowing analysis of GDP growth, stock indices, market capitalization, trade balances, and currency history.

ðŸ“‚ Database Schema

We created 4 main tables:

GlobalFinanceData

Country, Date, Stock Index, Index Value, Daily Change %, Market Cap (Trillion USD), GDP Growth Rate %

Country_Info

Country, Continent, Population (Million), Region, Currency

Trade_Data

Country, Exports (Billion USD), Imports (Billion USD), Year

Currency_History

Country, Currency, Year, Avg Exchange Rate vs USD

ðŸ“ˆ Skills Demonstrated

SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, etc.)

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY)

CTEs and Subqueries

Data Cleaning & Finance Insights

ðŸ“Œ Project Use Cases

Academic SQL projects

Finance/trade data exploration

Practice for data analyst interviews

Portfolio project for GitHub

ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations

Based on the SQL analysis of global finance data:

Diversify Trade Partners â€“ Countries running consistent trade deficits should diversify exports and negotiate better trade terms.

Focus on High-Growth Regions â€“ Investors can prioritize continents with above-average GDP growth (e.g., Asia, Africa) for expansion.

Currency Hedging â€“ Businesses trading across multiple countries should monitor exchange rate volatility and adopt hedging strategies.

Sector-Specific Investment â€“ Countries with strong market capitalization growth may present opportunities in financial markets.

Policy Adjustments â€“ Governments in deficit-heavy regions can implement import substitution or tariff reforms.
ðŸ”® Next Steps

To expand this project further:

Data Expansion â€“ Integrate more datasets (inflation, unemployment, interest rates, FDI) for holistic financial analysis.

Visualization â€“ Build dashboards in Power BI / Tableau / Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for better insights.

Predictive Modeling â€“ Use machine learning on GDP growth & stock indices for forecasting trends.

Automation â€“ Automate ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines for periodic updates of financial data.

API Integration â€“ Connect with real-time financial APIs (World Bank, IMF, Yahoo Finance) to keep data current.
