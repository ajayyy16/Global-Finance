# Global Finance SQL Analysis 

# ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project explores global finance and trade data using SQL.
The dataset contains financial, economic, and trade indicators across multiple countries, allowing analysis of GDP growth, stock indices, market capitalization, trade balances, and currency history.


# ðŸ“ˆ Skills Demonstrated

SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, etc.)
Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY)
CTEs and Subqueries
Data Cleaning & Finance Insights

# ðŸ“Œ Project Use Cases

Academic SQL projects
Finance/trade data exploration
Practice for data analyst interviews
Portfolio project for GitHub

# ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations

Based on the SQL analysis of global finance data:
Diversify Trade Partners â€“ Countries running consistent trade deficits should diversify exports and negotiate better trade terms.
Focus on High-Growth Regions â€“ Investors can prioritize continents with above-average GDP growth (e.g., Asia, Africa) for expansion.
Currency Hedging â€“ Businesses trading across multiple countries should monitor exchange rate volatility and adopt hedging strategies.
Sector-Specific Investment â€“ Countries with strong market capitalization growth may present opportunities in financial markets.
Policy Adjustments â€“ Governments in deficit-heavy regions can implement import substitution or tariff reforms.

# ðŸ”® Next Steps

To expand this project further:
Data Expansion â€“ Integrate more datasets (inflation, unemployment, interest rates, FDI) for holistic financial analysis.
Visualization â€“ Build dashboards in Power BI / Tableau / Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for better insights.
Predictive Modeling â€“ Use machine learning on GDP growth & stock indices for forecasting trends.
Automation â€“ Automate ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines for periodic updates of financial data.

API Integration â€“ Connect with real-time financial APIs (World Bank, IMF, Yahoo Finance) to keep data current.
